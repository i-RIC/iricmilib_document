What is iRIC-MI?
===================

iRIC-MI is the short name of iRIC Model Interface.

iRIC have been a system to setup input data, run a model, and visualize the result.
It has been dedicated for running a single model.

But recently, to execute simulations of complex phenomenon, it is becoming
important to connect models and run together, exchanging data each other.

iRIC-MI was developed for that purpose. iRIC-MI provides function to exchange data between models.
