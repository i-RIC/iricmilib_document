Basic workflow
==============================

This page describes the basic workflow to use iRIC-MI GUI.

1. Create New Project
2. Add subfolders for each models
3. Setup connections between models
4. Save project

Please refer to below for the detail.

.. _sec_iricmi_gui_create_new_project:

Create New Project
-----------------------

Select menu [File] -> [New Project] to create a new project.

When you select the menu, a dialog to select the folder to save project is shown.
Create an empty folder, select it, and click on [Select Folder] button.

.. note:: When you want to edit the project that you previously created,
   please use [File] -> [Open] menu, and select the iricmi_project.xml that you previously saved.

Please refer to :ref:`sec_iricmi_ref_file_newproject` for detail.

Add subfolders for each models
---------------------------------------

On [Models] tab of iRIC-MI GUI, click on [Add] button (Refer to :numref:`image_iricmi_gui_model_add_button`).
Then, [Add Model] dialog is shown (Refer to :numref:`image_iricmi_gui_add_model_dialog`).

On [Add Model] dialog:

1. Input the [Folder Name], in which you save the project for that model. 
2. Select the model to run, from the list in [Model] group box.
3. Click on [OK] button.

Then, the folder is created, and basic project information is saved to that folder.

You need to open the project with iRIC GUI, and setup input data for that model, i. e. calculation condition and input grid. You can do this by clicking on [Open] button
(Refer to :numref:`image_iricmi_gui_model_open_button`). Please refer to the iRIC User manual for detail about how to setup input data for each model using iRIC GUI.

We strongly recommend that you run each model separately from iRIC GUI, to make sure you've setup input data for the model correctly.

.. note:: You can use only ASCII characters for folder name.

.. note:: In [Model] group box, please select the model that implements iRIC-MI library. Currently, all iRIC models (that include the models that implement iRIClib library) are shown in the list, but actually, you can only use the models that implement iRIC-MI library.

   [Add] button on [Models] tab of iRIC-MI GUI

.. _image_iricmi_gui_add_model_dialog:

.. figure:: images/iricmi_gui_add_model_dialog.png

   [Add Model] dialog

.. _image_iricmi_gui_model_open_button:

.. figure:: images/iricmi_gui_model_openbutton.png

   [Open] button on [Models] tab of iRIC-MI GUI

Setup connections between models
---------------------------------------

On [Connections] tab of iRIC-MI GUI, click on "Add..." button (Refer to :numref:`image_iricmi_gui_connection_add_button`).
Then, [Add Connection] dialog is shown (Refer to :numref:`image_iricmi_gui_add_connection_dialog`).

On [Add Connection] dialog:

1. Select the [Model] and [Value] for Output.
2. Select the [Model] and [Value] for Input.
3. Click on [OK] button.

Then a connection between the selected Output and Input is created. Then while the models are running in "coupled" mode, the value that model output is passed to the model input.

.. note:: Please select the [Model] and [Value] of [Output] first, then those of [Input]. That's because the options in the combo boxes in [Input] group box changes dependent on what you select in the combo boxes in [Output] group box.

Save project
-----------------

Save the project, by selecting menu [File] -> [Save].

Then, the information about models and connections that you've setup is saved to iricmi_project.xml in the folder that you've selected in
:ref:`sec_iricmi_gui_create_new_project`.
