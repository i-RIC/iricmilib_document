About iRIC-MI GUI
======================

iRIC-MI GUI is the GUI program to prepare iricmi_project.xml,
and launch iRIC-GUI to open projects for each models in "coupled" mode.

iricmi_project.xml is the file that a user needs to prepare to run models in "coupled" mode.
Please refer to :ref:`sec_preparing_iricmi_project` for detail about iricmi_project.xml.

We strongly recommend to use iRIC-MI GUI to prepare iricmi_project.xml, because it is much easier,
than writing it manually.
