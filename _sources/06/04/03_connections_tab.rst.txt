On [Add Connection] dialog:

1. Select the [Model] and [Value] for Output.
2. Select the [Model] and [Value] for Input.
3. Click on [OK] button.

Then a connection between the selected Output and Input is created. Then while the models are running in "coupled" mode, the value that model output is passed to the model input.

   It will help users understand the relationship between the models, when the project contains many models and connections.
