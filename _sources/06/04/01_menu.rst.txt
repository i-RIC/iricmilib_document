.. note::

   It is important that you need to reload the project after you edited the input data of projects in the subfolders.

   For example, if you've added a boundary condition to the grid of a project in a subfolder, maybe you want to make a connection using the new boundary condition.
   In that case, you need to reload the project before adding a new connection, because iRIC-MI does not recognize the new boundary condition until the project is reloaded.
