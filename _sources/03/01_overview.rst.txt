This section describes how to run models that implements iRIC-MI library.

The model can be run in two modes below:

* "standalone" mode
* "coupled" mode

Running a model in "standalone" mode
----------------------------------------

In "standalone" mode, only one model is launched.

"standalone" mode will be used for simple simulations, that can done within one model.

Also, users will use "standalone" mode before running models in "coupled" mode, to make sure that input data for each model is appropriately prepared.

"standalone" mode will also be used when developer develop a new model using iRIC-MI library. When running a model in "standalone" mode, it is easier to debug.

To run a model in "standalone" mode, user should follow the steps below:

1. Preparing input data for the model
2. Running the model

.. _sec_prepare_input_data_using_iric:

Preparing input data for the model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a project for the model using iRIC GUI, and save as project folder.

Please refer to iRIC GUI User's manual to know how to prepare input data for models.

Running the model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User can run the model in two ways below:

* Running from iRIC GUI
* Running from shell (or command prompt)

Running from iRIC GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you open a project for a model, you can start running the model
with menu "Simulation" --> "Run", or clicking "Run" button in tool bar.

When launched in this way,  the log the model output to STDOUT is saved to consoleLog.txt in the project folder, and also displayed in "Solver Console Window".

Running from shell (or command prompt)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run from shell (on Linux) or command prompt (on Windows) with the steps below:

1. Chdir to the project folder where you've prepared input data in :ref:`sec_prepare_input_data_using_iric`.
2. Launch ``iricmi_run``.

When launched in this way, the log is saved to consoleLog.txt, and also displayed to the shell (or command prompt) window.

.. _sec_how_to_run_coupled:

Running models in "coupled" mode
------------------------------------

In "coupled" mode, ``iricmi_server`` and multiple models are launched,
and they run exchanging data each other through ``iricmi_server``.

The detail of how they exchange data is described in
:ref:`sec_sequence`.

We call it "coupled" mode, but actually the number of the models to launch is not limited to two, it can be three or four.

To run models in "coupled" mode, user should follow the steps below:

1. Preparing input data for each model
2. Preparing iricmi_project.xml.
3. Running the model

Preparing input data for each model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This step is identical to that for "standalone" mode.

At first, create a folder, that is the "root folder" of the "coupled mode" project, create subfolders in it, and save projects in the subfolders.

.. _sec_how_to_run_overview_iricmi_project:

Preparing iricmi_project.xml
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please create iricmi_project.xml in the "root folder", and define the settings related to model coupling.

:numref:`how_to_run_iricmi_project_example` shows an example of iricmi_project.xml.

.. code-block:: xml
   :caption: Example of iricmi_project.xml
   :name: how_to_run_iricmi_project_example
   :linenos:

   <iRICMIProject>
     <Models>
       <Model name="global_send_c++" nodes="1" />
       <Model name="global_receive_c++" nodes="1" />
     </Models>
     <Connections>
       <Connection>
         <From model="global_send_c++" type="global" name="discharge" />
         <To model="global_receive_c++" type="calculationCondition" name="discharge" />
       </Connection>
     </Connections>
   </iRICMIProject>

Please refer to :ref:`sec_preparing_iricmi_project` to know the detail about how to prepare iricmi_project.xml.

Running the model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run from shell (on Linux) or command prompt (on Windows) with the steps below:

1. Chdir to the "root folder" of "coupled project", where iricmi_project.xml exists.
2. Launch ``iricmi_run``

Sample solvers
-----------------

Two sets of sample solvers are bundled with iRIC-MI like below.
The source code of solvers are in testmodels folder.

* Solvers to send or receive global real value with name "discharge":

  * global_send
  * global_recieve

* Solvers to send or receive real grid attribute value defined at cell with name "rain":

  * grid_att_send
  * grid_att_recieve

Sample projects
-----------------------

Sample projects are bundled with iRIC-MI like below:

* global_send_receive: Run "global_send" and "global_receive" connected, to send/receive "discharge" value.
* grid_att_send_receive: Run "grid_att_send" and "grid_att_receive" connected, to send/receive "rain" value.
