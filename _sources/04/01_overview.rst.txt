Overview
================

The workflow to develop a model consists of the steps below:

1. Create "definition.xml"
2. Develop a model using iricmi library.
3. Deploy the files to "solvers" folder

.. _sec_create_def_abst:

Create "definition.xml"
----------------------------------

definition.xml is the file that defines the interface of the model.

It is loaded by ``iricmi_run``, ``iricmi_server``, and iRIC-MI library.

Please refer to :ref:`sec_creating_definition_xml` for detail about how to create it.


.. _sec_develop_using_iricmi:

Develop a model using iricmi library
--------------------------------------

Develop model using programming languages for which iRIC-MI library is prepared.

Currently, iRIC-MI library is prepared for the following languages:

* C/C++
* FORTRAN
* Python

Please refer to :ref:`sec_developing_model` for detail.

Deploy the files to "solvers" folder
--------------------------------------

Create a new subfolder under "private/solvers" folder in the path that
"IRICMI_ROOT_PATH" environmental variable refers, and deploy
definition.xml and the model executable to that folder.

``iricmi_run`` etc. scans the subfolders in "solvers" and "private/solvers" folder to
find models to run. "solvers" forlder is for official solvers, and we recommend you
use "private/solvers" folder to store the private solvers you've developed, to avoid confusion.
