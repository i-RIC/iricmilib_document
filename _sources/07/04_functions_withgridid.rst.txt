Functions with ``_WithGridId`` suffix
========================================

Functions that handle grid-related data have versions with the suffix  ``_WithGridId``.

The difference of functions with ``_WithGridId`` is that they have
an additional variable ``gridid``. Please use these functions if the model
you are developing handles multiple grids (such as both two-dimensional grid and three-dimensional grids).
