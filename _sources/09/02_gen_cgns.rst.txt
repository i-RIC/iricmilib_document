Running BMI model exchanging data with iRIC models
=========================================================

Run BMI model exchaning data with iRIC models.

:numref:`run_cem` shows the code to run CEM as a model that exchange data with iRIC models.

   cem = pymt.models.Cem()

   iricmi_pymt_util.buildCgns(cem, '/home/ubuntu/iricmilib/iricmi_pymt_util/template.cgn', '/home/ubuntu/iricmilib/iricmi_pymt_util/cem.cgn')


Source code of buildcgns.py that generates CGNS file is shown in :numref:`iricmi_pymt_util_buildcgns`.

.. note::

   For CEM, there was a limitation below:

   * Calling get_grid_x() and get_grid_y() caused exception. It seems that CEM does not support reading grid coordinates. through BMI. grid_ndim() and grid_shape() was functional, so a rectangular dummy grid is output to CGNS file.
